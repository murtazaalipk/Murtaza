Task 1 for a virtual intership of NextJS at internee.pk

Description:

This repository houses the codebase for my Next.js portfolio project, developed as part of a virtual internship focused on Next.js web development.

Project Highlights:

Next.js Framework: Leveraging the power and efficiency of Next.js for building a fast, server-rendered React application.

Multi-Page Structure: Creating distinct pages for the portfolio website, including the home, projects, about, and contact sections.

Custom UI Design: Crafting an engaging and responsive user interface using React components and various styling options such as CSS modules and styled-components.

Dynamic Data Showcase: Fetching and displaying project data dynamically from a JSON file to showcase my work effectively.

Client-Side Routing: Implementing smooth navigation between different pages using Next.js's built-in routing.

Deployment: Deploying the portfolio website to a hosting platform, ensuring it is accessible to anyone online.

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in Next.js development and showcases my ability to create a functional and visually appealing portfolio website.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
